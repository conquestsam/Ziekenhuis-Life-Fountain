## MY PROCESS

### Built with
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Flexbox
- JavaScript


### What I learned
During the course of this project, i learned how to implement the flexbox into my coode and also how to integrate thr forEach loop t loop through elements, targting them with the dom and adding event listener for interactiveness. 


### Continued development
I look forward to futhering my knowdledge on the forEach loop, using it effectively in future projects. 
I also want to refine and perfect my use of the addEventListener in JavaScript.
